# 10DaysofSolidity

Starting my 10 days of code challenge.

Focusing on Solidity Smart Contract Development.

Will be trying to make a token according to ERC-20 Standards.

Following this article: (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-programming-a-daily-habit/?fbclid=IwAR3Qbds7VPUm6Uy4N-E0vUtM0Ohl8T8UtfGYmzA-rHVVtT1G46P15Jh501M)

I will be committing daily with my progress

Day 1 starts from today.

# Day1:

Commit Hash(a7cd35b2fe29ab2a0047fa66d851d95e1aa5c499)

Made a smart contract named MyToken & added a function of TotalSupply() according to ERC20.

``uint supply;`` <- Total supply of our token will be initialized in this variable of uint type.

The function ``totalSupply()`` will return our ``supply`` variable.
