# 10DaysofSolidity

Starting my 10 days of code challenge.

Focusing on Solidity Smart Contract Development.

Will be trying to make a token according to ERC-20 Standards.

Following this article: (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-programming-a-daily-habit/?fbclid=IwAR3Qbds7VPUm6Uy4N-E0vUtM0Ohl8T8UtfGYmzA-rHVVtT1G46P15Jh501M)

I will be committing daily with my progress

Day 1 starts from today.

#10daysofcode 

# Day1:

Commit Hash(a7cd35b2fe29ab2a0047fa66d851d95e1aa5c499)

Made a smart contract named MyToken & added a function of TotalSupply() according to ERC20.

``uint supply;`` <- Total supply of our token will be initialized in this variable of uint type.

The function ``totalSupply()`` will return our ``supply`` variable.

# Day2:

Commit Hash(6dc83eed2e5ff7a0a3911a789f6f9be3e0089ecc)

Made a ``mapping (address => uint) balances;`` to store the address as key and uint as their balance.

Function ``balanceOf()`` will take an argument as address and will return its respective balance.

# Day3:

Commit Hash(3ca80ba560ab9b86c10757161a0f60505b05c57a)

Added public variables or getter and setter for our Token's Name, Symbol & Decimals as per ERC20.

# Day4:

Commit Hash(69d35391cdeedee09140043b239be6c9eb310c6e)

Added Transfer event & transfer() function for our Token.

# Day5:

Commit Hash(e4237e209544dbbb0e299719db90bb0c93c68a63)

I've added Approval event, allowance mapping and an approve() function as per ERC20. I've commented with the code explaining the purpose.
